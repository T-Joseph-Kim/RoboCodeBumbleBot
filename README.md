\**Beats benchmark AI bot by 70%.**
**Description:**
BumbleBot is an AI-driven robot developed for the Robocode programming game. It uses a state-based architecture to navigate the battlefield, scan for enemies, and engage in combat, adapting its strategy based on various conditions like proximity to enemies, walls, and its health status.

**Key Features:**
1. **State-Based Behavior:** BumbleBot operates using different states (e.g., scanning for enemies, moving, firing) that dictate its actions. It dynamically switches between states based on the battlefield situation, such as encountering multiple enemies, being close to a wall, or low health.

2. **Adaptive Combat Strategy:** The bot implements strategies like predictive targeting, which calculates enemy movement to aim and fire more accurately. It adjusts its firing power based on its energy levels and the distance to the enemy.

3. **Wall Avoidance and Evasion:** BumbleBot actively avoids walls and evades close enemies by changing direction or moving randomly, ensuring it stays in optimal positions during combat.

4. **Team Collaboration:** Designed for team battles, BumbleBot communicates with teammates, avoiding friendly fire and focusing on enemy targets.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Programming Language:** C#
- **Framework:** Robocode, an environment for AI-driven robotic combat simulation.
- **AI Techniques:** State machines, predictive algorithms, and adaptive decision-making processes.

**Why It Stands Out:**
BumbleBot demonstrates strong AI and algorithmic skills, particularly in handling real-time decision-making and complex scenarios. The project showcases the ability to develop intelligent systems that adapt to changing environments, a valuable skill in software engineering and AI development.
